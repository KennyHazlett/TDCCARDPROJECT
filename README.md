# # The Daily Caller Card Project

This project was developed for a job interview process as a demonstration of my capabilities as a frontend software developer. The Daily Caller Card Project is a dynamic, responsive, and interactive subscription pricing component developed using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Description

This application provides a responsive interface where users can toggle between two different subscription plans: "Monthly" and "Annual". The details for each plan (plan name, pricing, duration, and button style) dynamically update based on the user's selection. This interactive feature was implemented with JavaScript, and the responsive and modern design was created using CSS.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Pricing Toggle**: Users can seamlessly switch between "Annual" and "Monthly" subscription plans.
- **Dynamic UI Updates**: The interface responds to the user's toggle selection by updating the plan name, pricing, duration, and subscribe button style.
- **Modern and Responsive Design**: The design is modern and fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technical Overview

- **HTML**: The structure of the pricing component was built with HTML5. Semantic HTML was used for accessibility and SEO purposes.
- **CSS**: The styling of the component was done using CSS3, including features like flexbox for layout purposes and gradients for UI polishing.
- **JavaScript**: The interactivity of the pricing toggle was implemented using JavaScript. The `annualAndMonthlyToggle()` function dynamically updates the UI based on the user's selection.
